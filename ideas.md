# Handout ideas

## Topology

* Metrization theorems
  * Urysohn metrization
  * Bing metrization criterion (variation of Nagata-Smirnov; see below)
  * Moore metrization
  * Nagata-Smirnov metrization (this is the big one; it implies the other three and gives necessary and sufficient criteria)
    * There is a slightly stronger version by Hung [here](https://www.ams.org/journals/proc/1976-054-01/S0002-9939-1976-0405365-9/S0002-9939-1976-0405365-9.pdf).
* Generalizations/variations of metric spaces
  * Approach spaces
    * Give a "metric" for the Stone-Čech compactification of the integers
  * Gauge spaces (pseudometric space)
  * Premetrics, semimetrics, etc.
  * Metrizable TVS
* The [Blumberg theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blumberg_theorem) (related: Blumberg sets)
* Partitions of unity (show applications, maybe draw nice diagrams)
* Classification theorem for coverings on a given space

## Geometry

* Contact/symplectic geometry (talk to Zhenkun)
  * Moser's trick (one day!)
* Seifert-Van Kampen
* Classification theorem of compact surfaces
* Differential forms
* Various definitions of a tangent space

## Analysis

* Fourier analysis (similar to MORPH-level)
* Visual introduction to Lebesgue integration
* Calculus of variations
* Tensor calculus/Ricci calculus
* Nonstandard analysis

## Algebra

* Ado's theorem (Lie algebras)
* Topological groups
* Homological algebra (one day!)
* Jordan-Hölder theorem
* Commutative algebra stuff—learn it!!!
* Noncommutative algebra stuff
  * Lots of theorems (Wedderburn, Artin–Wedderburn, Jacobson density, Nakayama, localization)
* Localizations and valuations
* Krull-Schmidt theorem

## Number theory

* Transcendental numbers
* Cyclotomic fields

## Combinatorics

* Bernoulli numbers
* Stirling numbers
* Binomial sums (e.g., sums of products of binomials)

## Graph theory

* Basic extremal graph theory?
* Infinite Ramsey's theorem
* Idk I don't really like graph theory haha

## Foundations

* Schröder–Bernstein theorem

## Theorems with funny names

* Right-to-life (bypasses)
* Edge-of-the-wedge (complex analysis)
